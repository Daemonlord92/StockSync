Ticket #SS-101
Title: Initialize Basic WebSocket Inventory Service
Story Points: 5
Priority: High
Status: In Progress

Original Description: Create the foundational WebSocket service that will handle
real-time inventory updates.

Progress Update:
Completed:
- Project structure established
- Entity models created for inventory items
- Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) implemented
- WebSocket configuration set up with appropriate endpoints

Remaining Tasks:
1. Implement WebSocket controller for handling inventory updates
2. Create connection test functionality
3. Add basic error handling
4. Document the implemented endpoints
5. Write unit tests for the controller

Technical Dependencies:
- spring-boot-starter-websocket
- spring-boot-starter-data-jpa
- lombok
- h2database (for development)

Updated Technical Notes:
- Controller should implement both subscription handling and update processing
- Consider adding logging for connection events
- Remember to test with multiple concurrent connections
- Document message formats in the code

Estimated Remaining Time: 4-6 hours

Next Steps:
Focus on implementing the WebSocket controller. This will involve creating endpoints
for:
1. Handling client subscriptions to inventory updates
2. Processing inventory change messages
3. Broadcasting updates to subscribed clients

Remember to maintain a clean separation of concerns between the controller and
business logic layers. Consider implementing a service layer if you find the
controller growing too complex.
