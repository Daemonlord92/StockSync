# System Architecture Overview
Our system will follow a microservices architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability. Here's why and how we'll structure it:
Core Services

### Inventory Service (Our primary focus)

- Handles real-time inventory updates
- Manages WebSocket connections
- Processes inventory transactions


### Authentication Service

- Manages user authentication
- Handles session management
- Controls access permissions


### Analytics Service (Future Phase)

- Processes historical data
- Generates reports
- Handles business intelligence



## Technology Stack Selection
### Backend:

#### Spring Boot 3.x

Chosen for robust WebSocket support and extensive enterprise features
Excellent integration with security frameworks


#### Spring Security

Handles authentication and authorization
Provides WebSocket security


#### PostgreSQL

Reliable ACID compliance for inventory transactions
Excellent performance for our expected load


#### Redis

Session management
Caching frequently accessed inventory data


#### RabbitMQ

Message broker for service communication
Handles WebSocket message broadcasting



### Frontend:

#### React with TypeScript

Type safety for complex state management
Excellent ecosystem for real-time applications


#### TailwindCSS

Rapid UI development
Consistent styling


#### SockJS/STOMP

Fallback mechanisms for WebSocket connections
Structured message format



### CI/CD Pipeline

### Version Control:

GitLab for repository management
