# StockSync - Real-Time Inventory Management System

StockSync revolutionizes inventory management by providing immediate, real-time updates across all connected clients. When inventory changes occur, all stakeholders see the updates instantly, enabling better decision-making and reducing inventory discrepancies.

## System Architecture

At its core, StockSync operates as a specialized microservice focused on real-time inventory management. The system leverages Spring Boot's WebSocket capabilities to maintain live connections with clients, while RabbitMQ ensures reliable message delivery and proper ordering of inventory updates.

Our service processes inventory updates in real-time, broadcasting changes to all connected clients and maintaining data consistency through an optimistic locking mechanism. This prevents conflicts when multiple users attempt to update the same inventory item simultaneously.

## Technical Foundation

We've carefully selected our technology stack to provide robust, scalable real-time functionality:

Spring Boot 3.x serves as our primary framework, providing comprehensive WebSocket support and enterprise-grade capabilities. PostgreSQL handles our persistent storage needs, while Redis manages our caching layer for enhanced performance.

Essential Dependencies:
- Spring Boot WebSocket: Enables real-time bidirectional communication
- Spring Data JPA: Simplifies database operations
- RabbitMQ: Ensures reliable message delivery
- Lombok: Reduces boilerplate code
- H2 Database: Supports development and testing environments

## Getting Started

Before running StockSync, ensure you have installed:
- Java 17 or higher
- Maven 3.8+
- Docker (for local development)

Follow these steps to set up your development environment:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stocksync.git
cd stocksync
```

2. Build the project:
```bash
mvn clean install
```

3. Launch the service:
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## WebSocket Communication

StockSync's WebSocket endpoints enable real-time inventory management:

Connection Details:
- Base WebSocket URL: `ws://localhost:8080/inventory-ws`
- Subscribe to updates: `/topic/inventory`
- Send updates: `/app/inventory/update`

The system uses a standardized message format for all inventory updates:
```json
{
    "productId": "string",
    "quantity": "integer",
    "productName": "string",
    "timestamp": "ISO-8601 datetime",
    "updateType": "string"
}
```

## Development Best Practices

When contributing to StockSync, follow these essential practices to maintain code quality:

Write comprehensive unit tests for all new features. Document all WebSocket message formats thoroughly. Follow our branching strategy:
- Create feature branches as: `feature/description`
- Name bug fixes as: `fix/description`
- Tag releases as: `release/version`

## Local Development Environment

We provide a complete development environment through Docker Compose. Start it with:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This command launches:
- PostgreSQL database for persistent storage
- Redis cache for performance optimization
- RabbitMQ message broker for reliable message handling

## Testing Your Implementation

Run the complete test suite using:
```bash
mvn test
```

For WebSocket functionality testing, we provide a dedicated test client:
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run -Pwebsocket-test
```

## System Monitoring

Monitor your StockSync instance through these endpoints:
- Health status: `/actuator/health`
- Performance metrics: `/actuator/metrics`
- WebSocket statistics: `/actuator/websocket`

## Deployment Process

Our automated CI/CD pipeline, powered by Jenkins, handles deployment through these stages:
1. Runs comprehensive automated tests
2. Builds and validates Docker images
3. Deploys to staging environment
4. Promotes to production after approval
